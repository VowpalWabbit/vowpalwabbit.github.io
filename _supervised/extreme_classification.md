description: Extreme multi-class or multi-label learning addresses learning a classifier that can tag each data point with the most relevant label or subset of labels, from an extremely large label set. It has applications in document tagging, as well as ranking and recommendation systems by reformulating them as multi-label learning tasks, where each item to be ranked or recommended is considered as a separate label.
