      <p>
        Vowpal Wabbit is a machine learning framework that frames problems as reductions. The idea of a reduction is to reduce, or transform, one learning problem into another one that has already been solved. By combining several reductions large, complex problems can be easily solved. In fact, most learning problems reduce to gradient descent with a linear regression in VW! VW includes a highly optimized gradient descent implementation that has been tried and tested over many years.
