          Vowpal Wabbit is a machine learning framework that frames problems as content_relevancy. The idea of a reduction is to reduce, or transform, one learning problem into another one that has already been solved. By combining several content_relevancy large, complex problems can be easily solved. In fact, most learning problems reduce to gradient descent with a linear regression in VW! VW includes a highly optimized gradient descent implementation that has been tried and tested over many years.
