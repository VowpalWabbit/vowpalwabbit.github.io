# A successful first RLOS Fest

This (northern hemisphere) summer we had the absolute pleasure of collaborating with 6 students from 3 continents on solving real problems in the Vowpal Wabbit ecosystem. The Reinforcement Learning Open Source (RLOS) Fest was organized and run by Microsoft Research. RLOS was a remote program, so we were fortunate that as the world was adjusting to new circumstances, we were able to continue as planned.

There were over 200 applications for the program, and it was an incredibly difficult task to narrow down the many impressive applicants. In the end we landed on a final group of 6 and the amazing work done over this summer was a testament to the incredible talent that was attracted to the program. Thank you to all applicants for your interest!

You can learn more about the program at the MSR page [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/rl-open-source-fest/).
