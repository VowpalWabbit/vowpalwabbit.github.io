description: Contextual Bandits are a form of reinforcement learning, where one observes the environment, then makes a decision that optimizes for an observed reward.  The vast majority of production real world RL systems use Contextual Bandits because the number of samples needed to learn is very low compared to other forms of reinforcement learning.
