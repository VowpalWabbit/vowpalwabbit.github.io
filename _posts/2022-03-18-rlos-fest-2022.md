[Apply here!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/rl-open-source-fest/)

We had a big program in 2021 and we we're excited to be running RLOS Fest again for 2022. In case you didn't know, the program matches students with engineers at Microsoft Research to collaborate on open source projects in the Vowpal Wabbit ecosystem. It's a great way to get exposure to open source, engineering and machine learning.

To learn more about the program head to the [Microsoft Research page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/rl-open-source-fest/). The list of available projects for this year can be found [here](https://vowpalwabbit.org/rlos/2022/projects.html).

Applications close April 4, so make sure you apply soon!
