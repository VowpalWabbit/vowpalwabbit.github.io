For a long time John Langford and others has presented about VW at the yearly NeurIPS and ICML conferences. This year was no different, apart from the fact that for the first the first time NeurIPS was completely online and remote. Because of this the complete workshop is now accessible online too.

A huge thanks to everyone who presented, and especially Jacob Alber who organized the entire workshop.

The entire presentation is available [here](https://slideslive.com/38942331/vowpal-wabbit).
